    <h1>More about me.</h1>
    <p>I have started my jurney in Web Development back in 2021 in my first year of university, where I have gathered the basics and i have<br/>
    a little bit of everything, but since I finished my studies I have started to dive deep into Web Developement and my target is to become <br/>
    a Full Stack Developer by the end of the year.
    I have developed impresive self thaught skills throughout my life, like playing the guitar on an advanced level, I have learned programming<br/>
    in Java and C#, Game Development in Unity, I like to think about all of this as hobbies, because I out of all of them I have been enjoying<br/>
    Web Development the most.
    Also, outside of my computing skills I am a very active person, I do gardening and take care of the surroundings of my house, and also<br/>
    3 to 4 times a week I am going swimming to maintain myself healthy and active.</p>
